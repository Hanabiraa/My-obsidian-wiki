# Docker image

## definition

Docker images are the basis of [containers](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#container). An Image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime. An image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other. An image does not have state and it never changes.

> It's built out of [layers](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#layer) - each layer corresponds to a single line of instructions from a [[Dockerfile]]
