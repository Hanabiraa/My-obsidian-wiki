# Docker Engine

## definition

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

-   A server with a long-running daemon process [`dockerd`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd).
-   APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
-   A command line interface (CLI) client [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).
