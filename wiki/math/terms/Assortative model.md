# Assortative model


## definition
In a network with **assortative mixing** by degree the high-degree nodes (see [[Node degree]]) will be preferentially connected to other high-degree nodes, and the low to low. 

In a social network, for example,Â **we have assortative mixing if the gregarious people are friends with other gregarious people and the hermits with other hermits**
