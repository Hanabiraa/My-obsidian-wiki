# Graphs generation

#### Empirical network features:
- [[Power law]] [[Degree distribution]]
- Small average distance (graph diameter)
- Large [[Local clustering coefficient]] ([[transitivity]])
#### Generative models:
- [[Erdos-Renyi graph model]]
- [[Small world graph model]]
- [[Preferential attachment graph model]]
- [[Stochastic block model]]
- [[Random geometric graph]]


## Random model comparison

Some are more suitable for Small-world models


## Deep learning metods
see [[generative models]] volume, [[DDPM]], [[Discrete denoising diffusion for graph generation|Digress]] in particular
