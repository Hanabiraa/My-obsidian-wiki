# Graphs generation

#### Empirical network features:
- [[Power law]] [[Degree distribution]]
- Small average distance (graph diameter)
- Large [[Local clustering coefficient]] ([[transitivity]])
#### Generative models:
- [[Erdos-Renyi graph model]]
- [[Small world graph model]]
- [[Preferential attachment graph model]]
- [[Stochastic block model]]
- [[Random geometric graph]]
