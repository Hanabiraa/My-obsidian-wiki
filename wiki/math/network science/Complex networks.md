# Complex networks

## Types of networks

1. Scale-free - [[Power law distribution]]
2. Small-world networks - small diameter and average path lengths
3. Transitive network - high [[Local clustering coefficient]]

## Scale-free networks

### [[Degree distribution]] of Poisson graph vs Scale-free graph

On average 2 neighbors per node:
- Different structures
- Size of a node is proportional to the number of edges
- poisson - very similar node degrees

**Plot degree distribution**
- green - poisson
- purple - scale-free
